		<h3>About me</h3>
		
		<p class="content">As a designer and consultant, I work with startups to conceive and create products that people love, and advise them on how their brand can become a platform for massive growth.</p>
		
		<p class="content">I also help large, established companies use the best bits of startup thinking to find new markets, new business models and better ways of working.</p>
		
		<p class="content">When I have the time, I design and develop my own products and services.</p>
