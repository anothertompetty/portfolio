		<h3>How I work with startups</h3>

		<p class="content">As a designer and consultant, I work with startups to conceive and create products that people love, and advise them on how their brand can become a platform for massive growth.</p>

		<p class="content">This is achieved through product strategy, UX and interface design, and brand identity.</p>
		
		<h3>How I work with bigger companies</h3>

		<p class="content">I help large, established businesses apply the best bits of startup thinking to find new markets, new business models and better ways of working.</p>

		<p class="content">This is done through a mix of innovation workshops and prototyping. When appropriate, I partner with the best people &mdash; developers, entrepreneurs and strategists &mdash; to complete larger projects.</p>
		
		<p class="content">When I have the time, I design and develop my own products and services.</p>
