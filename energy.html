		<p class="left">The energy sector is undergoing a massive shake-up as profits fall, regulation increases and the public putting them under more scrutiny than ever. This can't be addressed through PR or a glossy coat of paint, but through long-term cultural changes.</p>

		<p class="left">Wolff Olins worked with a large Scandinavian energy company to help them meet these challenges. To help them become more open â€” to listen to people and at the same time, transform from self-proclaimed dinosaur to digitally native organisation. As the lead designer on the team, I helped define an approach that would allow the transformation to continue long after the project finished.</p>

		<p class="left">There were three parts to the approach: A new <span class="dark-text"><a href="#process">process</a></span> focused on listening, a <span class="dark-text"><a href="#pilot">pilot</a></span> that tested it out, and <span class="dark-text"><a href="#products">products</a></span> designed to improve experiences.</p>
		
		<p class="left">NB: due to the confidential nature of the work, this is a broad overview of the project, with some specifics deliberately avoided.</p>

		<p class="right"><strong>Process</strong></p>
		
		<p class="right">An ambition of this scale can't be done over the course of one project, it needed to be self-sustaining. We developed a process that would serve as a new way of working for everyone in the business. Borrowing from human-centred design and agile principles, the process puts people at the heart of everything the business does, and ensures the experiences people have are always the best they can be.</p>

		<p class="right">Part of this included a field guide for how the new way of working. Together with a colleague, we literally wrote the book on organisational design. We also created an online tool for employees to use whilst following the process. It provides a central place for all the data to be collected and shared around the organisation.</p>

		<p class="right"><strong>Pilot</strong></p>
		
		<p class="right">We knew we couldn't just launch a new way of working across a 30,000 employee company &mdash; we needed to start small. To test the process and gather some real data we launched a pilot in the winter of 2013. A small team of us from Wolff Olins spent a few weeks with the clients in Scandinavia, visiting customers and learning about their experiences and identifying ways to improve them.</p>

		<p class="right"><strong>Products</strong></p>
		
		<p class="right">As well as validating our approach, the pilot identified three new products that would immediately improve customers' experiences, thereby helping the business in it's transformation.</p>

		<p class="right">I worked with two great developers to create working prototypes that allowed us to gather real feedback, and also helped our client demonstrate the ideas to the business.</p>
