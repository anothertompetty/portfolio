        <p class="u-text-small">
          GoCardless makes recurring payments software for businesses. It started out serving small merchants, and when I joined the product had been built to do just that. However, as the company grew, a new vision evolved: to build the recurring payments network for the internet. With the new vision came a desire to serve bigger, more demanding merchants with vastly different needs. A new, more robust approach was needeed.
        </p>
        <p class="u-text-small">
          If the original product was a great proof of concept, the new one needed to be a truly scalable platform. That meant re-writing the code-base, launching a new API, and creating brand new dashboards and payment pages.
        </p>
        <p class="u-text-small">
          I led the design of the dashboard&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the place where merchants log in and manage their payments, as well as playing a leading role in the product strategy and management (what should we build? Why should we build it? When should we do it?).
        </p>

        <span class="u-padding-Tl">Approach</span>
        <p class="u-text-small">
          The goal was to create a new version of GoCardless that would enable large enterprise customers to use the system, without alienating the core userbase of small businesses. It had to work for everyone from vegetable boxes to Box.com.
        </p>
        <p class="u-text-small">
          The problem here is that by trying to design something for everyone, we risked helping no one. Avoiding the design equivelant of an identity crisis became a big focus of mine. We'd do this by finding ways to inject a point of view into the product&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;by knowing what it wasn't, as well as what it was.
        </p>
        <p class="u-text-small">
          There needed to be constraints, so we knew which targets to aim at, and this meant a whole load of user research. We met with potential & existing customers, spoke to the sales & support teams, and went over the analytics. We identified five key insights to get started:
        </p>

        <ul class="insight-list u-text-small">
          <li class="u-margin-Bm"><span class="u-text-heavy">
            Easy is everything.</span><br>
            "It just works!"
          </li>
          <li class="u-margin-Bm"><span class="u-text-heavy">
            Flexibility is missing.</span><br> 
            "I can’t change anything on a subscription once it's created"
          </li>
          <li class="u-margin-Bm"><span class="u-text-heavy">
            Visibility is important.</span><br> 
            "What’s going on with my business?"
          </li>
          <li class="u-margin-Bm"><span class="u-text-heavy">
            Ramping up is hard.</span><br> 
            "I love GC, I just wish I could get my customers on it!"
          </li>
          <li><span class="u-text-heavy">
            The paying experience is confusing.</span><br> 
            "Who are GoCardless?"
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          So we had insight into our users, but we needed more. We needed something to help guide design decisions, especially when we were at risk of creating one size fits all features. It led us to three design principles:
        </p>

        <ul class="insight-list u-text-small">
          <li class="u-margin-Bm"><span class="u-text-heavy">
            Small users over all users.</span><br>
            Small businesses are the heart of GC, and the primary dashboard users. The features we build, the information we show and the tone we adopt will be for them — we’ll design first and foremost to meet their needs.
          </li>
          <li class="u-margin-Bm"><span class="u-text-heavy">
            Attention over retention.</span><br>
            We’ll design to prioritise the things that require our users’ immediate attention, the rest can wait. We don’t need them to stick around if everything’s fine — they can get straight back to running their business.
          </li>
          <li><span class="u-text-heavy">
            Hammer over handyman.</span><br>
            GoCardless is designed to solve one problem really, really well. We could be great at other things, but we’ll design to ensure that we’re the best at recurring payments first, and worry about the rest later.
          </li>
        </ul>

          I actually gave a talk about our approach to the dashboard at Canvas Conference in October 2015. You can <a href="https://vimeo.com/144855160" target="_blank">watch the video here</a> (20 mins).

          At the time of writing, the dashboard and new product are in beta in France and Germany, and we’re in the final phase of build before launching fully.

          One of the biggest challenges was making something with a lot of power and flexibility feel natural to use. There were a lot of new features (great!), but my first attempts at including them made it really complex (bad!). A lot of work went in to incorporating this new power in a way that wouldn't hurt casual users.

        <p class="u-text-small">
          For me, the most interesting insight from the research was that our merchants were struggling to get their own customers to pay through GoCardless. If someone signs up, but can't get any one to pay them, nobody benefits.
        </p>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          I reduced the number of fields needed to add a customer from five to one, and introduced a new component allowing merchants to invite multiple customers in one click.
