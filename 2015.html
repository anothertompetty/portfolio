        <h2 class="title">GoCardless</h2>
        <p class="u-text-small">Here's some of my latest UI work for GoCardless. The aim is to make everything a bit less clever, and lot more obvious to users.</p>
        <p class="u-text-small">First up, overhauling our public-facing payment pages. Our merchants use these to take payments from their customers. The idea is to ask a lot less, use less space, but make it much chunkier and clearer:</p>
        <img src="img/placeholder.gif" data-src="img/work/gocardless/gocardless-payment-page.gif">
        <p class="u-text-small">Next is the form that merchants use to create subscriptions in our dashboards. I want them to be able to input the smallest amount of information possible, and still set up a payment plan. The form gradually reveals more options as they become relevant.</p>
        <img src="img/placeholder.gif" data-src="img/work/gocardless/gocardless-plan-create.gif">
        <p class="u-text-small">Certain options are directly related to the decisions that the user has just made. I want these relationships to be as obvious as possible.</p>
        <img src="img/placeholder.gif" data-src="img/work/gocardless/gocardless-plan-detail.jpg">
        <p class="u-text-small">It's currently too hard for merchant's to get their customers onto GC, so I'm looking at ways to make that easier (n.b. this stuff is still pretty rough, but wanted to share anyway).</p>

        <p class="u-text-small">Minale and London is a boutique property investment, restoration and management service. They bring together a network of agents, architects and product designers to create amazing spaces in London.</p>
        <p class="u-text-small">I'm working with Minale and London to create a brand identity and website that captures the spirit of their business. This includes a set of custom icons designed to communicate the different aspects of their offer.</p>

        <h2 class="title">Wolff Olins</h2>
        <p class="u-text-small">During my time at Wolff Olins I was lucky enough to work with some of the worlds most influential and exciting companies. These included Google, American Express, PwC and phone network EE. Due to the nature of the work, I can't talk about much, so below is a little snippet of what I was up to:</p>
        <h2 class="title">EE</h2>
        <p class="u-text-small">My first project at Wolff Olins was the creation of EE &mdash; a mobile phone provider that was the child of a merger between T-Mobile and Orange. I worked within a large team on what is still the biggest project of my life. My main contribution was the icons and icon language that are still used to represent their services.</p>
        <img src="img/placeholder.gif" data-src="img/work/ee/ee11.jpg">
        <img src="img/placeholder.gif" data-src="img/work/ee/ee2.jpg">
        <img src="img/placeholder.gif" data-src="img/work/ee/ee8.jpg">
        <img src="img/placeholder.gif" data-src="img/work/ee/ee7.jpg">
        
        <h2 class="title">American Express</h2>
        <p class="u-text-small">I worked with the innovation labs of American Express, serving as the design lead from Wolff Olins. We helped them identify new products and services aimed at a traditionally underserved part of their market: merchants.</p>
        <p class="u-text-small">Working with the team from the lab, we created a process for continuous innovation. This included facilitating workshops, helping spot key shifts in the market and coming up with ways to make the most of them.</p>
        <p class="u-text-small">We generated, prototyped and tested 15 ideas with customers, quickly refining what worked and ditching what didn't. This resulted in one product being built and launched in around a month.</p>
        <img src="img/placeholder.gif" data-src="img/work/amex/amex3.gif">

        <img src="img/placeholder.gif" data-src="img/work/amex/amex2.jpg">
        <p class="u-text-small">LOCL was a mobile app that let users get the inside track on all the shops and restaurants around them, giving everyone the benefits of being 'a local'. This provided merchants with a way to entice nearby users with the latest deals and inside information, in turn generating more business. This was the first step in proving that the business was on the side of the people accepting payments, and not just those making them.</p>
        <p class="u-text-small">As well as the work within the lab, I designed the brand identity for LOCL, and collaborated closely with <a href="http://ustwo.com/" target="_blank">Ustwo</a> to build and launch the iPhone app.</p>

        <h2 class="title">Scandinavian Energy Company</h2>
        <p class="u-text-small">Transforming the way an energy giant treats it's customers and thinks about technology.</p>
        <p class="u-text-small">The energy sector is undergoing a massive shake-up as profits fall, regulation tightens and a fed-up public are more vocal than ever. This can't be addressed with PR or a glossy coat of paint, It has to come through long-term cultural change. In fact before this project started, I wrote a <a href="http://blog.wolffolins.com/post/35265443757/the-dark-ages" target="_blank">blog post</a> about just how fed up I personally was with the sector.</p>
        <p class="u-text-small">At Wolff Olins I was able to try and address these issues by working with a large Scandinavian energy company. We helped them to become more open, to listen to people, and at the same time, transform from a self-proclaimed dinosaur to a digitally native organisation. As the lead designer on the team, I helped define an approach that would allow the transformation to continue long after the project finished.</p>
        <p class="u-text-small">There were three parts to our approach: a new process, focusing on people's needs; a pilot that tested it out; and products designed to improve customers experiences. We spent November 2013 in Sweden working with the clients and meeting customers in their homes.</p>
        <p class="u-text-small">NB: due to the confidential nature of the work, I can't show anything specific. However it's a story I'm proud of, and one that I think is worth including here.</p>
