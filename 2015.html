        <p>Hi, my name is Tom and I'm a designer. I'm currently living in London and working at <a rel="external" href="https://gocardless.com" target="_blank" class="highlight "data-image="gocardless">GoCardless</a>, where I lead an amazing design and user experience team.</p>

        <p>Before this I spent 3 years working at <a rel="external" href="http://wolffolins.com" target="_blank" class="highlight" data-image="wolff-olins">Wolff Olins</a> where I was a senior designer. Whilst there I helped create services, launch products and implement new ways of working. Clients included Google, American Express and PwC.</p>

        <p>My work is a mix of design, strategy and (front-end) development.</p>

        <p>I'd love to hear from you. My email is <a href="mailto:hello@anothertompetty.com">hello@anothertompetty.com</a></p>

        <h2 class="title">GoCardless</h2>
        <p class="u-text-small">I'm currently head of UX &amp; Design at GoCardless, a fin-tech
        start-up headquartered in London. GoCardless makes APIs and products that let businesses of any size easily accept recurring payments. We're now processing around $500m a year for clients such as The Guardian, Virgin and HM Government. Investors include Balderton and Y-Combinator.</p>
        <p class="u-text-small">Since joining in May 2014, I've led an overhaul of the website and visual identity; designed and product managed a new dashboard for enterprise users; and am helping define the product direction and roadmap. The next few months will see us consolidate two existing (and somewhat overlapping) products into one, modular experience.</p>

        <h2 class="title">Wolff Olins</h2>
        <p class="u-text-small">During my time at Wolff Olins I was lucky enough to work with some of the worlds most influential and exciting companies. These included Google, American Express, PwC and phone network EE. Due to the nature of the work, I can't talk about much, so below is a little snippet of what I was up to:</p>
        <h2 class="title">EE</h2>
        <p class="u-text-small">My first project at Wolff Olins was the creation of EE &mdash; a mobile phone provider that was the child of a merger between T-Mobile and Orange. I worked within a large team on what is still the biggest project of my life. My main contribution was the icons and icon language that are still used to represent their services.</p>
        <img src="img/placeholder.gif" data-src="img/work/ee/ee11.jpg">
        <img src="img/placeholder.gif" data-src="img/work/ee/ee2.jpg">
        <img src="img/placeholder.gif" data-src="img/work/ee/ee8.jpg">
        <img src="img/placeholder.gif" data-src="img/work/ee/ee7.jpg">
        
        <h2 class="title">American Express</h2>
        <p class="u-text-small">I worked with the innovation labs of American Express, serving as the design lead from Wolff Olins. We helped them identify new products and services aimed at a traditionally underserved part of their market: merchants.</p>
        <p class="u-text-small">Working with the team from the lab, we created a process for continuous innovation. This included facilitating workshops, helping spot key shifts in the market and coming up with ways to make the most of them.</p>
        <p class="u-text-small">We generated, prototyped and tested 15 ideas with customers, quickly refining what worked and ditching what didn't. This resulted in one product being built and launched in around a month.</p>

        <img src="img/placeholder.gif" data-src="img/work/amex/amex2.jpg">
        <p class="u-text-small">LOCL was a mobile app that let users get the inside track on all the shops and restaurants around them, giving everyone the benefits of being 'a local'. This provided merchants with a way to entice nearby users with the latest deals and inside information, in turn generating more business. This was the first step in proving that the business was on the side of the people accepting payments, and not just those making them.</p>
        <p class="u-text-small">As well as the work within the lab, I designed the brand identity for LOCL, and collaborated closely with <a href="http://ustwo.com/" target="_blank">Ustwo</a> to build and launch the iPhone app.</p>

        <h2 class="title">Scandinavian Energy Company</h2>
        <p class="u-text-small">Transforming the way an energy giant treats it's customers and thinks about technology.</p>
        <p class="u-text-small">The energy sector is undergoing a massive shake-up as profits fall, regulation tightens and a fed-up public are more vocal than ever. This can't be addressed with PR or a glossy coat of paint, It has to come through long-term cultural change. In fact before this project started, I wrote a <a href="http://blog.wolffolins.com/post/35265443757/the-dark-ages" target="_blank">blog post</a> about just how fed up I personally was with the sector.</p>
        <p class="u-text-small">At Wolff Olins I was able to try and address these issues by working with a large Scandinavian energy company. We helped them to become more open, to listen to people, and at the same time, transform from a self-proclaimed dinosaur to a digitally native organisation. As the lead designer on the team, I helped define an approach that would allow the transformation to continue long after the project finished.</p>
        <p class="u-text-small">There were three parts to our approach: a new process, focusing on people's needs; a pilot that tested it out; and products designed to improve customers experiences.</p>
        <p class="u-text-small">NB: due to the confidential nature of the work, I can't show anything specific. However it's a story I'm proud of, and one that I think is worth including here.</p>
