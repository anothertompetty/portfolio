        <p class="u-text-small">
          GoCardless makes recurring payments software for businesses. It started out serving small merchants, and when I joined the product had been built to do just that. However, as the company grew, a new vision evolved: to build the recurring payments network for the internet. With the new vision came a desire to serve bigger, more demanding merchants with vastly different needs. A new, more robust approach was needeed.
        </p>
        <p class="u-text-small">
          If the original product was a great proof of concept, the new one needed to be a truly scalable platform. That meant re-writing the code-base, launching a new API, and creating brand new dashboards and payment pages.
        </p>
        <p class="u-text-small">
          I led the design of the dashboard&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the place where merchants log in and manage their payments, as well as playing a leading role in the product strategy and management (what should we build? Why should we build it? When should we do it?).
        </p>

        <span class="u-padding-Tl">Approach</span>
        <p class="u-text-small">
          The goal was to create a new version of GoCardless that would enable large enterprise customers to use the system, without alienating the core userbase of small businesses. It had to work for everyone from vegetable boxes to Box.com.
        </p>
        <p class="u-text-small">
          The problem here is that by trying to design something for everyone, we risked helping no one. Avoiding the design equivelant of an identity crisis became a big focus of mine. We'd do this by finding ways to inject a point of view into the product&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;by knowing what it wasn't, as well as what it was.
        </p>
        <p class="u-text-small">
          There needed to be constraints, so we knew which targets to aim at, and this meant a whole load of user research. We met with potential & existing customers, spoke to the sales & support teams, and went over the analytics. We identified five key insights to get started:
        </p>

        <ul class="insight-list u-text-small">
          <li class="u-margin-Bm"><span class="u-text-heavy">
            Easy is everything.</span><br>
            "It just works!"
          </li>
          <li class="u-margin-Bm"><span class="u-text-heavy">
            Flexibility is missing.</span><br> 
            "I can’t change anything on a subscription once it's created"
          </li>
          <li class="u-margin-Bm"><span class="u-text-heavy">
            Visibility is important.</span><br> 
            "What’s going on with my business?"
          </li>
          <li class="u-margin-Bm"><span class="u-text-heavy">
            Ramping up is hard.</span><br> 
            "I love GC, I just wish I could get my customers on it!"
          </li>
          <li><span class="u-text-heavy">
            The paying experience is confusing.</span><br> 
            "Who are GoCardless?"
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          So we had insight into our users, but we needed more. We needed something to help guide design decisions, especially when we were at risk of creating one-size-fits-all features. It led us to three design principles:
        </p>

        <ul class="insight-list u-text-small">
          <li class="u-margin-Bm"><span class="u-text-heavy">
            Small users over all users.</span><br>
            Small businesses are the heart of GC, and the primary dashboard users. The features we build, the information we show and the tone we adopt will be for them — we’ll design first and foremost to meet their needs.
          </li>
          <li class="u-margin-Bm"><span class="u-text-heavy">
            Attention over retention.</span><br>
            We’ll design to prioritise the things that require our users’ immediate attention, the rest can wait. We don’t need them to stick around if everything’s fine — they can get straight back to running their business.
          </li>
          <li><span class="u-text-heavy">
            Hammer over handyman.</span><br>
            GoCardless is designed to solve one problem really, really well. We could be great at other things, but we’ll design to ensure that we’re the best at recurring payments first, and worry about the rest later.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          The principles helped me a lot throughout the process. Each time I couldn't work out how to approach a problem, I'd come back to them to help me get back on track.
        </p>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          I actually gave a talk about our approach to the dashboard at Canvas Conference in October 2015. You can <a href="https://vimeo.com/144855160" target="_blank">watch the video here</a> (20 mins).

        <p class="u-text-small">
          The GoCardless dashboard is a web app that merchants visit to take payments, manage customers, and reconcile accounts. They can set up subscriptions, refund payments, and transfer funds. If you're interested, you can <a href="https://manage.gocardless.com/signup" target="_blank">sign up for a beta account</a> now.

        <p class="u-text-small">
          One of the biggest challenges was making something with a lot of power and flexibility feel natural to use. There were a lot of new features (great!), but my first attempts at including them made it really complex (bad!). A lot of work went in to incorporating this new power in a way that wouldn't hurt casual users.

        <p class="u-text-small">
          For me, the most interesting insight from the research was that our merchants were struggling to get their own customers to pay through GoCardless. If someone signs up, but can't get any one to pay them, nobody benefits.
        </p>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          I reduced the number of fields needed to add a customer from five to one, and introduced a new component allowing merchants to invite multiple customers in one click.
        </p>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          I worked on a few small, but fun details along the way. For example, the password strength-o-meter on the sign up form loves it when you enter something un-hackable:
        </p>

        <div class="video">

        </div>

        <p class="u-text-small">
        Tables are a large part of the app, and so I designed hover states that change colour depending on the status of the item. It makes them much easier to glance through quickly.
        </p>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          These examples might seem small, but I think they do a really important job. Payments software is notriously hostile to users, and it was important that GoCardless sent a message that it's different.
        </p>

          At the start of the project I was really keen to incorporate elements of Google's Material design framework. I thought the form elements in particular would fit in perfectly, and so I worked with a front-end developer to roll them out into the app. Unfortunately it quickly became clear that whilst well designed, the Material stuff just wasn't robust enough for a large-scale web app&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;especially one that relied so heavily on forms. 
        </p>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          Instead I created a UI component library that could be used throughout the dashboard. This worked well, and made it super quick for the team to consistently design and implement complex features. It put the focus on solivng the problem at hand, rather than worrying about stying, and re-inventing the wheel every time.

          For me, one of the best bits of this project was the opportunity to get my hands dirty and write a modest amount of production code. According to GitHub, I was the 7th biggest contributor to the repository!
