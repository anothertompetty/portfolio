    	<p class="u-text-body">Hi, my name is <u>Tom Petty</u> and I'm a designer. I'm currently living in London and working for <a href="https://gocardless.com" target="_blank">GoCardless</a>, where I'm helping to build an amazing team.</p>
    	<p class="u-text-body">Before this I spent 3 years working for <a href="http://wolffolins.com" target="_blank">Wolff Olins</a> where I was a senior designer. Whilst there helped create services, launch products and implement new ways of working. My clients included Google, American Express and PwC along with many others.</p>
    	<p class="u-text-body">Before all of that I worked for myself and for startups, designing mobile apps and identities. I also played in a <u>band</u>, <u>produced</u> music and taught people to <u>sail</u>.</p>
    	<p class="u-text-body">My work seems to be a mix of product &amp; service design, UX, strategy, branding and (front-end) development.</p>
    	<p class="u-text-body">I'd love to hear from you. My email is <a href="mailto:hello@anothertompetty.com">hello@anothertompetty.com</a></p>
