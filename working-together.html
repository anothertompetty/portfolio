          If you've got something that needs working on but aren't quite sure where to start, please do get in touch. I can look at the different possibilities, and shape a brief around your specific circumstances. If it turns out that I'm the perfect fit, great! If not, I can almost certainly introduce you to someone who is.
        </p>
        <p class="u-text-small">
          There's no one particular way that I like to work, but over the years I've found that most projects encompass one or more of the sections below:
        </p>
        <h2 class="text--title">User Insight</h2>
        <p class=" u-text-small">
          What your customers say and do is, of course, different. The question is: why?
        </p>
        <p class="u-text-small">
          I’ll work with you to uncover the motivations behind user behaviour, and develop real insights you can apply across your business — from product development to customer service.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text--title">Experience vision & strategy</h2>
        <p class=" u-text-small">
          With a solid understanding of your customers, you’re in a great position to define the way they experience your products. 
        </p>
        <p class="u-text-small">
          I can audit the current experience, identify opportunities and areas for improvement, and work with you to develop a vision for the future. When combined with customer insights, an inspiring vision will help you ensure your products have a point of view&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;something crucial in today’s ever changing market. Finally, I’ll work with you to create a roadmap of projects to achieve your goals.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text--title">Product & service design</h2>
        <p class=" u-text-small">
          You’ve got a roadmap of exciting projects to deliver, so let’s get to work.
        </p>
        <p class="u-text-small">
          I have a lot of experience designing and launching websites, apps, and experiences that customers love. To make sure we’re on the right track, I'll create prototypes and test with real customers; and to get big projects shipped I can assemble a top notch team from a small, tight network of collaborators.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text--title">Consultancy</h2>
        <p class=" u-text-small">
          Sometimes you’ve just got more questions than answers, and aren’t sure where to start.
        </p>
        <p class="u-text-small">
          I can work with you on an ongoing or ad-hoc basis, providing advice on subjects including: what to do with your current products; where new opportunites lie; hiring designers; and building a robust design process.
        </p>

          As I mentioned, there really is no one-size-fits-all project, so please feel free to <a href="mailto:hello@anothertompetty.com">email me</a> to discuss working together.
