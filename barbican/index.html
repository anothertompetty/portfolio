          After speaking with users, and testing initial prototypes, it became clear that a big part of the day to day job was reporting their organisation's cashflow position to superiors. To address this we created a 'boss board' view that distilled everything a financial controller needed to know, whilst hiding away unnecessary functionality.
        </p>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          The big focus of the board is showing the current, as well as expected funds, and the likey time to get paid. This means executives can stop looking in the rearview mirror, and make decisions around allocating capital more effectively.

          I worked as the sole designer on this project, partnering with a business and technical founder. I conducted user research, prototyped designers, and tested then tested those. Insights were quickly distilled into something that could be quickly built and put into the hands of beta testers. I also created a component library and set of design principles to allow the team to continue building out and prototying features.
