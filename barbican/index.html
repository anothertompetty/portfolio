          I’m lucky enough to live in the Barbican &mdash; an iconic modernist landmark slap bang in the middle of the City of London. Living there can be wonderful. Concrete towers stretch to the sky, whilst private gardens reveal themselves to those who possess The Residents' Key.
        </p>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          Things aren’t always rosy, however. The Barbican is getting on a bit, and at 40 acres, there’s a lot to maintain. Issues crop up. Elevators break. Tiles crack. Ceilings leak. Worst of all, there’s no way to manage the repairs of these various issues, whether they’re in a private apartment, or on a public lawn.
        </p>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          A quick stroll round on a sunny morning revealed the following:
        </p>

        <figure class="project-fig">

        </figure>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          This is why I was so excited to be set the following brief:
        </p>

        <ul class="insight-list">
          <p class="u-text-small u-text-heavy">Brief:</p>

          <p class="u-text-small">A great residential community provides a variety of amenities and a dedicated staff responsible for its maintenance . But there isn’t always an easy way for community members to report problems to management so they can be resolved quickly. </p>

          <p class="u-text-small last">Design a system for a community of your choice, so members can report issues and track their resolutions. Show your process and how you arrived at your solution. Please include a sequence of high-fidelity mocks from your design solution.</p> 
        </ul>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          This is the story of how, over a couple of days, I researched and designed an app for Barbican residents to log and track issues, both in their homes and on the estate.
        </p>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          The app addresses specific needs learned directly from residents, provides contact details for non-estate issues, and lets users securely message with the maintenance team at the estate office.
        </p>
        <p class="u-text-small">
          I approached this in two parts:
        </p>

        <ul class="insight-list u-text-small">
          <li class="u-margin-Bm"><span class="u-text-heavy">

          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="constraint u-text-small">
          <span class="u-text-heavy u-text-highlight">Constraints:</span><br>
          As this was to be done over a matter of hours, I set a few constraints. Whenever you see a box like this, it highlights a constraint, compromise, or assumption that’s been made for the sake of the task. In a live situation I’d avoid these, or find a way to test them.
        </p>

        <h2 class="u-margin-Txl u-margin-Bm">Part 1: Building the right thing</h2>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          Let’s start at the very beginning: what’s really the problem here?
        </p>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          To ensure I created something that met the challenge of the brief, but also the needs of residents, I needed to go out and talk to some. Whilst I wanted to understand a bit about them, I was primarily focused on what issues they’ve had, how they currently deal with them, and how they feel about it.
        </p>

        <figure class="project-fig">
          <img src="/img/placeholder.gif" data-src="/img/work/barbican/questions.jpg">

        <p class="constraint u-text-small">
          <span class="u-text-heavy u-text-highlight">Constraint:</span><br>
          To save time, I only spoke to two people about their experiences, and both were fairly tech-literate. In a real situation I’d want to interview 15 or so people, as well as send a survey out to the wider residents population.
        </p>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          I met Camilla and Thom in their lovely apartments. They talked me through problems that had occurred, and how they’d gone about trying to report them. To keep them top of mind, I created a very lightweight profile of each. In a real situation, these could inform segments or personas:
        </p>

        <figure class="project-fig">
          <img src="/img/placeholder.gif" data-src="/img/work/barbican/persona-camilla.png">

        </figure>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          Using a simple interview technique, I asked them to talk me through specific incidents. As we went I captured what they did, why, and how it made them feel. I put the notes in a simple Google Sheet.
        </p>

        <figure class="project-fig">

          Their stories included a broken intercom, a blocked drain, and trying to get some vandalised plants taken care of.
        </p>

        <figure class="project-fig">

        </figure>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          Looking at these stories, as well as what Camilla and Thom were thinking and feeling allowed me to create a simple experience map. 

        </p>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          An experience map is a way of capturing a complete picture of a user’s journey. It helps spot patterns and identify needs and opportunities.
        </p>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          For this exercise I condensed a lot of it, and managed to pull out key stages, objectives, and behaviours. I also layered in what they were feeling, and started to pull out some insights.
        </p>

        <figure class="project-fig">
          <img src="/img/placeholder.gif" data-src="/img/work/barbican/exp-map-master.png">
          <figcaption>An experience map generated from the interviews</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          A few themes started to emerge: issues can be serious and upsetting; knowing who to talk to is not immediately obvious; knowing when to ask the Barbican is unclear; and it’s hard to know what to do with communal spaces.
        </p>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          I grouped these into five core needs, each backed by a simple insight. These would be my north star: for any solution to be a success, it needed to demonstrably address the needs of its users:
        </p>

        <ul class="insight-list u-text-small">
          <li class="u-margin-Bm"><span class="u-text-heavy">
            Reassurance</span><br>
            Issues in the home are emotional
          </li>
          <li class="u-margin-Bm"><span class="u-text-heavy">
            Ownership</span><br> 
            Communal areas are as important as private
          </li>
          <li class="u-margin-Bm"><span class="u-text-heavy">
            Knowledge</span><br> 
            Who is responsible is not immediately clear
          </li>
          <li class="u-margin-Bm"><span class="u-text-heavy">
            Control</span><br> 
            Finding who to talk to wastes a lot of time
          </li>
          <li><span class="u-text-heavy">
            Clarity</span><br> 
            Visibility and clarity are as important as resolution
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          Now that I've met (at least a few) users, and identified their needs, I can frame the contours of the design challenge. By re-writing the insights as ‘how might we…’ questions, I can think creatively whilst remaining sure that I’m not losing site of the needs of residents.
        </p>

        <ul class="insight-list u-text-small">
          <li class="u-margin-Bm"><span class="u-text-heavy">
            How might we&hellip;</span><br>
            Reassure and support residents in a stressful situation?
          </li>
          <li class="u-margin-Bm"><span class="u-text-heavy">
            How might we&hellip;</span><br> 
            Enable and encourage residents to report issues in communal areas?
          </li>
          <li class="u-margin-Bm"><span class="u-text-heavy">
            How might we&hellip;</span><br> 
            Help residents understand when to report an issue?
          </li>
          <li class="u-margin-Bm"><span class="u-text-heavy">
            How might we&hellip;</span><br> 
            Create a way for residents to make a report to the right place, and fast?
          </li>
          <li><span class="u-text-heavy">
            How might we&hellip;</span><br> 
            Keep residents in the loop, and alert them of updates as soon as we have them?
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          Now that I have the questions to answer, it’s time to get on with the process of designing a way for residents to manage issues where they live.
        </p>

        <h2 class="u-margin-Txl u-margin-Bm">Part 2: Building the thing right</h2>

        <p class="u-text-heavy">Ideas</p>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          I spent some time with each ‘how might we’ question, brainstorming different ways to answer them.
        </p>

        <figure class="project-fig">
          <div class="owl-carousel">
            <img src="/img/placeholder.gif" data-src="/img/work/barbican/ideas-1.jpg">

        </figure>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          I then went back through each, highlighting the ideas that I believed best addressed the needs uncovered in the discovery phase.
        </p>

        <p class="constraint u-text-small">
          <span class="u-text-heavy u-text-highlight">Constraint:</span><br>
          If there was a team on this, I’d ensure they were included in this part of the process. I’d also apply a more rigorous way of prioritising ideas, for example an impact/effort matrix.
        </p>

        <p class="u-margin-Tl u-text-heavy">Flows</p>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          Looking through the highlighted ideas, and where they converged, helped me identify two core journeys to focus on: logging and tracking.
        </p>

        <ul class="insight-list u-text-small">
          <li class="u-margin-Bm"><span class="u-text-heavy">
            Logging</span><br>
            Reporting an issue to the right person, at a time that suits the user
          </li>
          <li><span class="u-text-heavy">
            Tracking</span><br> 
            Being kept in the loop about what's happening, and when
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          With this in mind I started sketching ways to bring these ideas to life. In the examples below you can see how I started very broad &mdash; there are no ‘devices’ &mdash; and gradually honed in on the core flows. Once I was happy with the flows, I iterated on key areas to ensure I’d covered different ways of executing the ideas. For example, the final sketch explores a ‘chat bot’ for logging issues. Ultimately I chose not to pursue this as it felt over-engineered for a simple app, however it informed some of the tracking functionality that I’ll discuss shortly.
        </p>

        <figure class="project-fig">

          <span class="u-text-heavy u-text-highlight">Constraint:</span><br>
          At this point in a live project, I’d find a way to get some feedback before doing another iteration. Perhaps a paper prototype in Marvel, or another discussion with users. I’d focus on the problems, not my solutions. “I think you have this problem. Do you?” etc.
        </p>

        <p class="u-margin-Tl u-text-heavy">Designs</p>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          With the user needs and core journeys mapped out, it was time to think about the interface. For this, I’ve decided to create an app, as it will allow users to make the most of built-in technology when logging issues. Things like cameras and GPS can come in handy on a maze-like 40 acre estate. 
        </p>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          With no ‘Barbican residents’ brand to work with, I started by exploring variations of colour and type &mdash; including looking at the existing Barbican identity &mdash; to establish a visual language.
        </p>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          With a lightweight visual language in place, it was time to mock-up the key flows.
        </p>

        <figure class="project-fig">

          <span class="u-text-heavy u-text-highlight">Constraint:</span><br>
          It became clear that, with the limited time and resource, following an existing style wasn’t important. I decided to create a simple, unique set of components that didn’t follow the Barbican Centre’s brand.
        </p>

        <p class="u-margin-Tl u-text-small u-text-heavy">
          Logging issues
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          During the research, I discovered that a lot of the same issues come up again and again. To address this, the logging flow has a ‘common issues’ component at the top.
        </p>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          This section also allows users to log issues in their home or in the communal space — something that was currently unclear to residents.
        </p>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          The flow focuses on what matters: the type of issue, and detail around it. It doesn’t need any personal information (address, contact etc.), as users would have added this as part of the onboarding (I’ve not looked at that flow in this project).
        </p>

        <figure class="project-fig">
          <div class="owl-carousel">

          Once logged, users are given an expected timeframe for resolution. This is something that was very important to the interviewees. Technically, this can be based on historical averages, and wouldn’t need any fancy AI.
        </p>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          Another feature to come out of residents’ need for knowledge is ‘useful contacts’. This section sits at the bottom of the categories, and provides users with direct ways to contact their landlord &mdash; or tradespeople &mdash; in an emergency. This is important as the Barbican aren’t responsible for everything, and it’s currently very unclear to residents when they should get in touch.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          To make sure the flow works on screen as well as paper, I created a quick Framer prototype with some of the key interactions. This level of fidelity will be fine for early user testing.
        </p>

        <figure class="project-fig">

        <p class="u-text-small">
          Tracking logged issues was just as important as knowing how to log them. Visibility and clarity were key needs, which can be addressed with a spot of transparency.
        </p>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          Once a user’s logged an issue, they can keep track of its status (logged, booked, resolved) within the app, as well as message directly with maintenance staff. One useful feature would be the ability to book and confirm appointments. This would all be contained in the same view, ensuring users never lose context, and know exactly where they stand.

          Finally, to ensure users are never out the loop, they can choose to receive push notifications when the status of their issue changes, or they receive a message from the Barbican team.

        <p class="u-text-small">
          The above represents a first stab at a simple app that addresses its users’ core needs. However, there’s no way to know for sure. As next steps I’d recommend the following:
        </p>

        <ul class="insight-list u-text-small">
          <li class="u-margin-Bm"><span class="u-text-heavy">
            User testing</span><br>
            Test a simple Framer prototype with potential users. Focus on things like task completion ("Can you log a broken boiler for me please?").
          </li>
          <li class="u-margin-Bm"><span class="u-text-heavy">
            Iteration</span><br> 
            Take the learnings from that and do another round of iterations. Make sure the app is effective as possible whilst it’s still in prototype form and therefore cheap to change.
          </li>
          <li class="u-margin-Bm"><span class="u-text-heavy">
            Feasibility</span><br> 
            If I was part of a team, I'd want to speak to the engineers and make sure what's proposed is technically feasibile within the reality of the constraints.
          </li>
          <li><span class="u-text-heavy">
            Pilot</span><br> 
            Once built, I’d recommend running a simple pilot scheme, perhaps initially with a small group of residents. We could take their feedback on board and ship regular updates every 1 or 2 weeks. The pilot could grow to a general release over a period of 12 weeks.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="constraint u-text-small">
          <span class="u-text-heavy u-text-highlight">Constraint:</span><br>
          One thing I’ve deliberately not covered here is the admin system used by the internal team at the Barbican. However for a pilot, I would suggest looking into ways to prototype this via a Slack integration, Intercom app, or similar. That would allow the maintenance team to message residents and update statuses, whilst the proposition was ironed out.
        </p>

        <p class="u-margin-Tl u-text-small u-text-heavy">
          What do I think?
        </p>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          Thanks for asking. Overall I think the flows above represent a good first step, however they’re nothing more. I’m not presenting this as a ‘solved’ problem, as I have no way of knowing without getting it into the hands of real people.
        </p>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          I will say that I think some aspects work well: the simple logging and the contextual timeline for tracking; whilst some areas need improvement: there’s no consistent way to advance screens, no reusable CTA’s.
        </p>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          I hope residents of the Barbican would enjoy using the app, spending lazy Sundays logging broken benches, and taking photos of leaky balconies.
        </p>

        <p class="u-text-small">
          Thanks so much!
