		<p class="left">EE is Britain's largest mobile network with over 28 million customers. Formed by the merger of Orange and T-Mobile, Wolff Olins helped EE create a brand new business that would go from total unknown to the most recognisable in the country.</p>

		<p class="left">As the biggest network in the UK, and the first to offer 4G, the brand was built around the idea of 'now you can' &mdash; emphasising the benefit this has for customers. The identity showed this through a 'smart layer' &mdash; a visualisation of the network's power. The work won a Brand New award and a Cannes Lion.</p>

		<p class="right">I was part of a large team, and focused on the digital aspect of the project, specifically looking at how the identity could behave online. I also developed the icon language, and created the initial illustrations for EE's propositions; for example, superfast broadband and Film Store. These have become some of the most widely seen parts of the identity.

		<p class="right">The illustrations were developed to work online, on telly and in store. They needed to be able to adopt behaviours, and communicate complicated things (like 4G) to people in a way that was easily understood. Some of the initial rough development work can be seen at the end.</p>

		<p class="right">You can now see this work everywhere in the UK. Numerous agencies have rolled out large ad campaigns and there's an EE store in pretty much every town.</p>

		<p class="right">I've left out a lot of work that I can't show in public, and have tried to focus on the parts that I had a large hand in developing. However, loads of amazing people worked on this project, and I certainly can't take the credit for it. All images here are &copy; EE, Wolff Olins or their respective owners.</p>
