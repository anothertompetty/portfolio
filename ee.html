		<p class="left">EE is Britain's largest mobile network with over 28 million customers. Formed by the merger of Orange and T-Mobile, Wolff Olins helped EE create a brand new business that would go from total unknown to the most recognisable in the country.</p>

		<p class="right">As the biggest network in the UK, and the first to offer 4G, the brand was built around the idea of 'now you can' &mdash; emphasising the new possibilities for customers. The identity showed this through a 'smart layer' &mdash; a visualisation of the network's power. The work won a Brand New award and a Cannes Lion.</p>
		
		<p class="right">I was part of a large team, and focused on the digital aspect of the project, specifically looking at how the identity could behave online. I developed the primary icon language seen below, and created the initial illustrations for EE's superfast broadband, film and music stores. These have become some of the most widely seen parts of the identity.</p>

		<p class="right">The illustrations were developed to work online, on telly and in store. They needed to be able to adopt behaviours, and communicate complicated things (like 4G) to people in a way that was easily understood. Some of the initial rough development work can be seen at the end.</p>

		<p class="right">You can now see this work everywhere in the UK. Numerous agencies have rolled out massive ad campaigns and there's an EE store in pretty much every town.</p>

		<p class="right">I've left out a lot of work that I can't show in public, and have tried to focus on the parts that I had a large hand in developing. However, loads of amazing people worked on this project, and I certainly can't take the credit for it. All images here are &copy; EE, Wolff Olins or their respective owners.</p>
