        <h2 class="title">GoCardless</h2>

        <img src="img/placeholder.gif" data-src="img/work/gocardless/balances.jpg">

        <p class="u-text-small">
          GoCardless makes recurring payments software for businesses. It started out serving small merchants, and when I joined the product had been built to do just that. However, as the company grew, a new vision evolved: to build the recurring payments network for the internet. With the new vision came a desire to serve bigger, more demanding merchants with vastly different needs. A new, more robust approach was needeed.
        </p>
        <p class="u-text-small">
          If the original product was a great proof of concept, the new one needed to be a truly scalable platform. That meant re-writing the code-base, launching a new API, and creating brand new dashboards and payment pages.
        </p>
        <p class="u-text-small">
          I led the design of the dashboard&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the place where merchants log in and manage their payments, as well as playing a leading role in the product strategy and management (what should we build? Why should we build it? When should we do it?).
        </p>
        <img src="img/placeholder.gif" data-src="img/work/gocardless/gc-office.jpg">
        <caption>The GC office</caption><br>

        <span class="u-padding-Tl">Approach</span>
        <p class="u-text-small">
          The goal was to create a new version of GoCardless that would enable large enterprise customers to use the system, without alienating the core userbase of small businesses. It had to work for everyone from vegetable boxes to Box.com.
        </p>
        <p class="u-text-small">
          The problem here is that by trying to design something for everyone, we risked ending up with something for no one. Avoiding an identity crisis by injecting a point of view into the way we designed features became a big focus of mine.
        </p>
        <p class="u-text-small">
          We needed constraints, a target to aim at. This meant a whole load of user research: meeting with potential & existing customers, speaking to our sales & support teams, and looking over the analytics. We identified five key insights to get us started:
        </p>
        <ul class="u-text-small u-margin-Bm">
          <li><span class="u-text-heavy">
            Easy is everything.</span> ("It just works!")
          </li>
          <li><span class="u-text-heavy">
            Flexibility is missing.</span> ("I can’t change anything on a subscription once it's created")
          </li>
          <li><span class="u-text-heavy">
            Visibility is important.</span> ("What’s going on with my business?")
          </li>
          <li><span class="u-text-heavy">
            Ramping up is hard.</span> ("I love GC, I just wish I could get my customers on it!")
          </li>
          <li><span class="u-text-heavy">
            The paying experience is confusing.</span> ("Who are GoCardless?")
          </li>
        </ul>
        <img src="img/placeholder.gif" data-src="img/work/gocardless/lendable.jpg">
        CAPTION: Lendable etc.
        <p class="u-text-small">
          It also helped us identify our primary users, and create personas based on their behaviours and needs. Here’s a sample:
        </p>
        <img src="img/placeholder.gif" data-src="img/work/gocardless/persona.jpg">
        <p class="u-text-small">
          So we had insight into our users, but we needed more. We needed something to help guide design decisions, especially when we were at risk of creating one size fits all features. It led us to three design principles:
        </p>
        <ul class="u-text-small u-margin-Bm">
          <li class="u-margin-Bm"><span class="u-text-heavy">
            Small users over all users.</span><br>
            Small businesses are the heart of GC, and the primary dashboard users. The features we build, the information we show and the tone we adopt will be for them — we’ll design first and foremost to meet their needs.
          </li>
          <li class="u-margin-Bm"><span class="u-text-heavy">
            Attention over retention.</span><br>
            We’ll design to prioritise the things that require our users’ immediate attention, the rest can wait. We don’t need them to stick around if everything’s fine — they can get straight back to running their business.
          </li>
          <li><span class="u-text-heavy">
            Hammer over handyman.</span><br>
            GoCardless is designed to solve one problem really, really well. We could be great at other things, but we’ll design to ensure that we’re the best at recurring payments first, and worry about the rest later.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="u-text-small">
          Between our personas and our principles we had everything we needed to get started.
        </p>
        <p class="u-text-small">
          For more detail on this approach, I actually gave a talk at Canvas Conference in October 2015, you can view a video of that HERE.

        <p class="u-text-small">
          At the time of writing, the dashboard and new product are in beta in France and Germany, and we’re in the final phase of build before launching fully.

        <h2 class="title">Wolff Olins</h2>
        <p class="u-text-small">During my time at Wolff Olins I was lucky enough to work with some of the worlds most influential and exciting companies. These included Google, American Express, PwC and phone network EE. Due to the nature of the work, I can't talk about much, so below is a little snippet of what I was up to:</p>
        <h2 class="title">EE</h2>
        <p class="u-text-small">My first project at Wolff Olins was the creation of EE &mdash; a mobile phone provider that was the child of a merger between T-Mobile and Orange. I worked within a large team on what is still the biggest project of my life. My main contribution was the icons and icon language that are still used to represent their services.</p>
        <img src="img/placeholder.gif" data-src="img/work/ee/ee11.jpg">
        <img src="img/placeholder.gif" data-src="img/work/ee/ee2.jpg">

        <img src="img/placeholder.gif" data-src="img/work/ee/ee7.jpg">
        
        <h2 class="title">American Express</h2>
        <p class="u-text-small">I worked with the innovation labs of American Express, serving as the design lead from Wolff Olins. We helped them identify new products and services aimed at a traditionally underserved part of their market: merchants.</p>
        <p class="u-text-small">Working with the team from the lab, we created a process for continuous innovation. This included facilitating workshops, helping spot key shifts in the market and coming up with ways to make the most of them.</p>
        <p class="u-text-small">We generated, prototyped and tested 15 ideas with customers, quickly refining what worked and ditching what didn't. This resulted in one product being built and launched in around a month.</p>
        <img src="img/placeholder.gif" data-src="img/work/amex/amex3.gif">

        <img src="img/placeholder.gif" data-src="img/work/amex/amex2.jpg">
        <p class="u-text-small">LOCL was a mobile app that let users get the inside track on all the shops and restaurants around them, giving everyone the benefits of being 'a local'. This provided merchants with a way to entice nearby users with the latest deals and inside information, in turn generating more business. This was the first step in proving that the business was on the side of the people accepting payments, and not just those making them.</p>
        <p class="u-text-small">As well as the work within the lab, I designed the brand identity for LOCL, and collaborated closely with <a href="http://ustwo.com/" target="_blank">Ustwo</a> to build and launch the iPhone app.</p>

        <h2 class="title">Scandinavian Energy Company</h2>
        <p class="u-text-small">Transforming the way an energy giant treats it's customers and thinks about technology.</p>
        <p class="u-text-small">The energy sector is undergoing a massive shake-up as profits fall, regulation tightens and a fed-up public are more vocal than ever. This can't be addressed with PR or a glossy coat of paint, It has to come through long-term cultural change. In fact before this project started, I wrote a <a href="http://blog.wolffolins.com/post/35265443757/the-dark-ages" target="_blank">blog post</a> about just how fed up I personally was with the sector.</p>
        <p class="u-text-small">At Wolff Olins I was able to try and address these issues by working with a large Scandinavian energy company. We helped them to become more open, to listen to people, and at the same time, transform from a self-proclaimed dinosaur to a digitally native organisation. As the lead designer on the team, I helped define an approach that would allow the transformation to continue long after the project finished.</p>
        <p class="u-text-small">There were three parts to our approach: a new process, focusing on people's needs; a pilot that tested it out; and products designed to improve customers experiences. We spent November 2013 in Sweden working with the clients and meeting customers in their homes.</p>
        <p class="u-text-small">NB: due to the confidential nature of the work, I can't show anything specific. However it's a story I'm proud of, and one that I think is worth including here.</p>
