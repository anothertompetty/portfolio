		<p class="left">Daysmiths is a site that tells you what to do with your day. I designed and built it primarily for myself since I never know what to do in my spare time.</p>
		
		<p class="left">It provides curated, complete days straight from real people, including their tips, must-sees and watch-outs. Every item has a unique action so you can view their route, check the menu, or book a ticket. Currently in beta, Daysmiths will be launching properly at the end of May.</p>

		<p class="right">For those interested in this sort of thing, Daysmiths is built to be fully responsive, compiled with Jekyll and powered by Github Pages</p>
